# MScCGT_FINAL_THESIS_SCRIPTS

This repository contains the scripts used in the final thesis project (FPS Survival). 


The scripts were uploaded AFTER the demo's submission for the thesis.
In order to preserve the state of the submitted demo, no update has been done on the game since then. That means, that there is no record of the progress on the scripts, and they are presented in their final form.
The reason for that is that I started learning git after I had completed my thesis.

All the scripts are included inside the subfolders and no other asset has been added in this repository. The reason for that is that this repository serves only to show the scripts used in the demo and not the demo itself. For that, there are pictures from the game, as well as the link to the final playable version in my portfolio: https://tzamouranis.wixsite.com/portfolio/fps-demo

For any questions, please do not hesitate to send me an email at: nikitastzamouranis@hotmail.com

Thank you for your time  :)
